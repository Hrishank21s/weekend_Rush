🎱 Weekend Rush Table Tracker (V2)
This project contains two HTML-based table tracking apps designed for managing snooker and pool table usage and billing at clubs or gaming centers. These lightweight tools use JavaScript and localStorage to help operators track session durations, calculate charges, and manage daily totals — all locally in the browser.
