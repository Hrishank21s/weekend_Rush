# Table Tracker System

This repository contains several versions of a Table Tracker System built with Python and Flask, providing real-time management of snooker and pool tables for gaming centers, clubs, and cafes. It supports desktop and mobile interfaces, session/bill tracking, price settings, user management, and more.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Start, pause, and end sessions for each table, with timers and billing calculated automatically.
- **Snooker & Pool Support:** Manage multiple snooker and pool tables independently, each with customizable rates and session histories.
- **Session History:** Persistent session data for each table, including start/end time, amount, and date. Easily clear session data.
- **Rate Settings:** Change per-minute rates for each table (when idle) from a modern settings panel.
- **Split Bill:** Divide session amount among any number of players.
- **Mobile Interface:** Lightweight mobile web UI for remote table control.
- **User Management:** (Pro/Enhanced versions) Secure login system, admin/staff roles, add/remove users, role-based access.
- **Clean UI:** Modern, responsive UI with smooth scrolling, color-coded statuses, and easy navigation between Snooker and Pool.
- **Network Ready:** Access via local network IP; auto-opens on your browser.

   cd weekwndrush
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh

   Or use other versions as needed (see below for script options).

4. **Access the app:**

   üì± Mobile Interface: http://192.168.1.100:8080/mobile
   ```

   Open these URLs in your desktop or mobile browser on the same network.

## Default Credentials (for login-enabled versions)

- **Admin:**  
  Username: `admin`  
  Password: `admin123`
- **Staff:**  
  Username: `staff1`  
  Password: `staff123`

## Customization

- **Number of Tables:**  
  Edit the relevant Python script(s) and modify the `self.snooker_tables` and `self.pool_tables` dictionaries as needed.
- **Pricing Options:**  
  Modify the `self.available_rates` list in each script.
- **Port:**  
  By default, the app runs on port 8080. Change the `port=8080` argument in the script to use another port.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug.
- Only admin users can add/remove other users (in login-enabled versions).
- Do **not** use the default `SECRET_KEY` in production; update it in the script.

## Troubleshooting

- If the web UI doesn't open, check your firewall and make sure the chosen port (8080) is open.
- If running on a server or VM, make sure to use the correct local IP and that your device is on the same network.
